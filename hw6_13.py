# Write a function called middle(lst) that takes a list and returns a new list
# that contains all but the first and last elements. For example:
# t = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# middle(t) should return [2, 3].
# Hint: use slice to get all but the first and last elements.

def middle(lst):
    # Replace the pass statement with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(middle([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # [2, 3]
    print(middle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # [2, 3, 4]
    print(middle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # [2, 3, 4, 5]
