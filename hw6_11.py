# Write a function called nested_sum(lst) that takes a list of lists of integers 
# and adds up the elements from all of the nested lists. For example:
# t = [[1, 2], [3], [4, 5, 6]]
# nested_sum(t) should return 21.

def nested_sum(lst):
    # Replace the pass statement with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(nested_sum([[1, 2], [3], [4, 5, 6]]))  # 21
    print(nested_sum([[1, 2], [3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]))  # 45
