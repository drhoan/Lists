# Write a function called cumsum(lst) that takes a list of numbers 
# and returns the cumulative sum; that is, a new list 
# where the ith element is the sum of the first i + 1 elements from the original list. 
# For example:
# t = [1, 2, 3]
# cumsum(t) should return [1, 3, 6].

def cumsum(lst):
    # Replace the pass statement with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(cumsum([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 3, 6]
    print(cumsum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
    print(cumsum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))  # [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55]
